# ShellcodeLoader

To begin, execute the XOR.exe along with the shellcode payload and specify the encryption key. 
This will initiate the process of applying XOR encryption to your payload, ensuring that it's properly obfuscated for further use.

Next, paste the code into Visual Studio and compile it to generate the executable. This will convert your source code into a runnable program, ready for execution.

Next, run the ShellcodeLoader.exe, providing the "shellcode_enc.bin" file that was generated using XOR.exe. This will load the encrypted shellcode and prepare it for execution.
